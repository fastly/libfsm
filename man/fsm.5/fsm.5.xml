File Format

The format of .fsm files is rather simple. Lexical conventions are:

 * Whitespace is ignored
 * Comments begin # and run to the end of the line

States are named numerically. State IDs are non-sequential positive integers starting from 1. The value 0 is reserved for internal use, and thus may not be used in the .fsm file format.

Edges are one of the following kinds of transition:

 * Labels, for human-readable strings. Empty labels are not legal.
 * Character literals, for execution as a DFA
 * Epsilon transitions
 * Any character (a single-character wild-card)

Examples:

0; 1; 2; 3; # declarations to force numbering in order

0 -> 1;       # illegal (0 is reserved)
1 -> 2;       # epsilon
2 -> 3 "";    # illegal (empty label)
4 -> 4 "abc"; # label
5 -> 5 'x';   # literal
6 -> 6 'xx';  # illegal
7 -> 7 '';    # illegal (empty literal)
8 -> 8 ?;     # any

End states are optional. Exactly one start state must be specified:

start: 1;
end: 2, 3, 4; # a list of several end states

There are some examples showing how the format looks in practice.
